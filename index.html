                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            An average air duct cleaning price is $365 or between $260 and $480. However, for homeowners with large homes, the price can be as large as $700.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Duct cleaning is recommended after every 5-8 years in order to maintain your home’s air duct system working efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the main determinants of the price of duct cleaning are the entire number of vents, size of ductwork, the degree of contamination and ease of access of your ductwork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We would be wrong to conclude that if there is a presence of dirt and dust in your home, it’s in the air you breathe and in your air ducts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dirt and dust will eventually, over time, accumulate on your HVAC system and furnace and compromise the performance of such elements.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    So, while cleaning your ducts helps you breathe clean air, it also affects the performance of your HVAC system positively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, with all those benefits, you should compromise the comfort of your home regardless of how large duct cleaning price might be. It is well worth it in the short and long term.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cleaning service you go for should emphasize on maximizing energy efficiency and improving indoor air quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This may encompass cleaning the heat exchangers, drain pain, coils, blowers, etc.. In the process of cleaning your air ducts, your air duct cleaner may discover other bigger issues that need an immediate solution.

                <p>
                    Well after answering the question of how much is air duct cleaning price, let’s discuss the cost of cleaning the vents today.
                </p>

                    Generally, it is going to cost you between $25-$50 to clean one vent. The typical cost is $35 so to know about how much you would pay for cleaning all of the cents in your home, count the vents and multiply that by $35.

                        <p>
                            4. Commercial Vs Home Duct Cleaning Price
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Industrial duct cleaning price greater than residential duct cleaning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, even though you might pay $25-$35 for residential duct cleaning work, for commercial duct cleaning, you’ll need to pay 30 percent more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since different companies offer different rates, it’s always clever to compare unique costs to be sure that you are getting a good deal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5. Amount Of Furnaces And AC Units
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In case you have several furnaces, you’re likely to pay more. Each extra furnace will cost you additional $400 on average.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    6. Rats And Mice
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rodents will always increase the duct cleaning price. Nevertheless, these are friends who shouldn’t be tolerated in your home because they can cause respiratory problems to your family members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see droppings in your vents, call your duct cleaning company when possible. Rat examinations will cost you between $100-$500 on top of duct cleaning.

                    7. Accessibility
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most houses have utility rooms and basements that offer easy access to the central air system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if your duct cleaner has to get some hard-to-reach places like tight crawlspaces or attics, that could mean increased duct cleaning price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How much is air duct cleaning price for inaccessible places? That will vary by location, builder and project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8. HVAC Mold And Mildew Elimination
                </p>
                <p>
                    On your typical cost of cleaning the ducts, you should consist of removal and professional price of approximately $500-$2000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting rid of these elements takes time, and it needs using special equipment and substances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, if the mold and mildew infection are too severe, your duct cleaner will refer you to a specialist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, you don’t have to worry about this. At Comfort clean, everything is handled to your satisfaction.

                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM AIR DUCT CLEANING SERVICES
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our crew is asked about duct cleaning quite frequently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continental Carpet Cleaning recently started offering this support, so we’d like to help our clients make an educated decision about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s discuss why you should consider having your ducts cleaned and what to expect from the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why Is Air Duct Cleaning Important?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fresh duct system means cleaner air for you and your family . As bookshelves get dusty over time, so does the duct work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, it can collect dirt, pollen, allergens and pet dander — which are then circulated around your dwelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This considerably reduces your indoor air quality and comfort, particularly for people who suffer from allergies, asthma or other respiratory conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How Do You Know If You Need A Duct Cleaning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your furniture or drapes are dusty, your house is more than a decade old, or a family member’s allergies are acting up, those are good signs that you should explore air duct cleaning services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case you’ve recently remodeled, you definitely stirred up enough dust to warrant a cleaning as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some ducts have been filthy from the time the home was built. It was commonplace — particularly in the’70s,’80s and’90s — for builders not to clean the ducts after finishing construction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The National Air Duct Cleaners Association recommends cleaning your home’s ducts every five years.

                    What's Contained In Air Duct Cleaning Services?
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <div class="two-col">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            We begin the process by taking photos of the inside of your ducts to document the”before” condition. Thenwe determine the best cleaning method for your specific situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the cleaning, we eliminate every register grill and do port cleanup as well. Ultimately, we deodorize the ducts and provide”after” photos so that you can see the difference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The entire process could take two to eight hours, depending on the size of your residence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not all duct cleaning services are created equal, however. Beware of low-cost solutions, as they frequently simply take off your registers and use a wet/dry vacuum to clean out the supply duct as far as it can reach. That is not what you want.

                    How Much Does Air Duct Cleaning Price? How Long Does It Last?
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Like many services, you get what you pay for when it comes to duct cleaning. Frankly, a $99 duct cleaning deal isn’t going to be effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purchase price should be determined by the size of your house, amount of ducts and their configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good duct cleaning will provide five years of fresh air for your family. Consider it as an investment in your family’s health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to choosing a local duct cleaning company not all air duct cleaning services are created equal, so it’s important to understand what factors determine how much it will cost to clean the air duct system in your home or business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A legitimate heating and air conditioning company should have appropriate HVAC and contracting licenses, and be fully insured. In addition to multiple residential & commercial HVAC certifications, licenses, and insurance, Capital Heating & Cooling in New Berlin, WI is certified by the National Air Duct Cleaning Association.
                </p>
